Build scripts for ffmpeg on iPhone SDK 3.0 (and iPhone Simulator SDK).

You'll need to get the latest gas-preprocessor and install it in /usr/local/bin or some other directory in your $PATH via http://github.com/yuvi/gas-preprocessor/

For background, follow this thread:

To make lipo'able libraries, you need to use gcc-4.2 with extra cflags instead of the specific arm-apple-darwin10-gcc-4.2.1 compiler.

The armv6 arch doesn't seem to be working properly so you can force building via armv7 on your 3GS until we figure that out.

The combine-ffmpeg-libs script will call lipo -create on each of the static libs.

The current ffmpeg trunk doesn't build with arm, so had to go back to r22274 in order to build arm targets. The i386 build does work on trunk (r22610) when I tried last.
